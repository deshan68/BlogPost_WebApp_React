# React Blog App With CRUD Operations

## I am using Local_Sever_Hositng json file to Fetching, Deleting and Patching for data. 

### Using following command we can start hosting json file in local server
### `npx json-server -p 3500 -w data/db.json`
#### In this case `3500` is our port_number and `data/db.json` is location of `db.jason` file. In my case i have create a folder name `data` then create `db.json` file inside of that folder.
### after run above command in terminal, we can see link where the that `json` file is hosted. In this case `http://localhost:3500/posts` is the link where the json file hosted. 
## In the following image, we can see how the `db.json` file appears after the hosting on the local server
